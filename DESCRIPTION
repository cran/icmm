Description: Empirical Bayes variable selection via ICM/M algorithm for normal, binary logistic, and Cox's regression. The basic problem is to fit high-dimensional regression which sparse coefficients. This package allows incorporating the Ising prior to capture structure of predictors in the modeling process.
